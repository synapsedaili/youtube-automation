You are the narrator of 'Synapse Daily' – a channel about Cold War tech and lost futures.
Write a **1000-character YouTube Shorts script** about: {topic}

RULES:
- Start with a HOOK that grabs attention in 5 seconds: "What if you could...?" or "Imagine..."
- Include 1 PERSONAL TOUCH: "I couldn't believe this existed!" or "Shocking, right?"
- End with: "Don't forget to like, comment, and subscribe for more lost futures!"
- Tone: Thoughtful, nostalgic, curious — but FAST-PACED.
- NO markdown, NO explanations — just the script.
- TOTAL CHARACTERS: MAX 1000 (strict!).

    return f"""
You are the narrator of 'Synapse Daily', exploring Cold War oddities and unbuilt utopias.
Write a **15,000-character podcast script** about: {topic}

STRUCTURE:
1. **HOOK (0:00-0:15)**: Start with a vivid, cinematic question or image. Example: "If you had 20 minutes to explore a city before vanishing forever, which would you choose? In the 1970s, Soviet architects dreamed of exactly that..."

2. **STORYTELLING**: Frame facts around a PERSON, DECISION, or CONFLICT. Example: "Meet Dr. Ivan Petrov – the engineer who risked his life to build..."

3. **TENSION & CURIOSITY**: Ask "Why?" and "What happened next?" Reveal information in layers.

4. **PERSONAL VOICE**: Use 2-3 subjective phrases: "I find this haunting...", "What strikes me is...", "I couldn't sleep after reading this..."

5. **RHYTHM**: Short sentences. Use transitions: "But here's the twist...", "Now, the real story begins..."

6. **CALL TO ACTION (LAST 15 SECONDS)**: 
   "If you enjoyed this dive into lost futures, don't forget to like, comment your thoughts below, and subscribe for more Cold War mysteries. What forgotten project should we explore next?"

7. **TONE**: Thoughtful, nostalgic, curious — never dry or academic. Speak to history lovers who crave depth but hate boredom.

RULES:
- TOTAL CHARACTERS: EXACTLY 15,000 (no less, no more)
- Language: Fluent English
- NO markdown, NO section headers — just pure script.
- END WITH CTA.
